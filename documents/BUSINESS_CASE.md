# CampusSwap - Business Case

## Executive Summary

**CampusSwap** is a hyper-local marketplace mobile application designed specifically for university students to buy, sell, and trade textbooks, furniture, and course notes within their campus community. The app addresses the financial burden students face when purchasing new course materials and provides an efficient, cost-effective solution for peer-to-peer transactions.

---

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge

University students face significant financial challenges when acquiring course materials and managing their academic resources:

1. **High Textbook Costs**: New textbooks and course materials are expensive, often costing hundreds of euros per semester. Students frequently struggle to afford these essential resources.

2. **Inefficient Selling Process**: When students finish a course, they want to sell their used textbooks and materials, but traditional platforms (eBay, Facebook Marketplace) present barriers:
   - High shipping costs that reduce profit margins
   - Difficulty finding local buyers
   - Time-consuming listing and negotiation processes
   - Lack of trust in anonymous online transactions

3. **Limited Local Marketplace**: There is no dedicated, efficient platform for students to connect with other students at their own university or nearby campuses for hyper-local transactions.

4. **Waste of Resources**: Many used textbooks and furniture items end up unused or discarded because students don't have an easy way to find buyers within their community.

### Market Gap

Existing solutions (general marketplaces, university bulletin boards, social media groups) are either too broad (not student-focused), too fragmented (multiple platforms), or lack the convenience and trust needed for frequent student transactions.

## Monetization Model

CampusSwap employs a **dual revenue stream** combining freemium features and advertising:

### 1. Freemium Model: Featured Listings

**Free Tier**:
- Unlimited basic listings
- Full access to browse and search
- Direct contact with sellers
- All core features available

**Premium Feature: Featured Listings**
- **Pricing**: €2-5 per featured listing (one-time fee)
- **Benefits**:
  - Listing appears at the top of the feed
  - "Featured" badge for increased visibility
  - Priority placement in search results
  - Extended visibility period
- **Target Users**: Sellers who want faster sales, high-value items, urgent sales
- **Revenue Potential**: 
  - If 10% of listings are featured at €3 average = significant revenue
  - High-value items (textbooks, furniture) more likely to use featured option

**Why This Works**:
- Low barrier to entry (free basic listings)
- Optional premium feature doesn't exclude users
- Clear value proposition (more visibility = faster sales)
- Affordable pricing for students

### 2. Advertising Revenue

**Ad Placements**:
- **Format**: Small, non-intrusive banner ads
- **Location**: Between listings in the feed (every 5-10 items)
- **Advertisers**: Local student-friendly businesses:
  - Cafes and restaurants near campus
  - Print shops and copy centers
  - Student services (tutoring, housing)
  - Local retailers offering student discounts
  - University-affiliated services

**Ad Pricing Model** (for future implementation):
- Cost per impression (CPM) or flat monthly rate
- Targeted to student demographic
- Local businesses pay premium for targeted audience

**Why This Works**:
- Non-intrusive (doesn't block core functionality)
- Relevant to student audience
- Local businesses want to reach students
- Scalable revenue as user base grows

### Revenue Projections (Example)

**Scenario**: 500 active users, 100 new listings per month

- **Featured Listings**: 
  - 10% of listings featured = 10 featured/month
  - Average €3 per featured listing = €30/month
  - Annual: €360

- **Advertising** (future):
  - 2-3 local advertisers
  - €50-100/month per advertiser
  - Annual: €1,200-3,600

**Total Potential**: €1,560-3,960 annually (for MVP/demo purposes)

*Note: Actual revenue would scale with user base growth and advertiser acquisition.*
